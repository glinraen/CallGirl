A barebones starter app with jquery and bootstrap v3.3.5 on the frontend, mongoid and activerecord (together!) as well as redis-objects (if you don't use it you should! <3 ). Ruby 2.2.1 and Rails 4.2.4. No models, only a home controller, and no real views. its very barebones, but a good starting point. Officialy its a mysql app from teh point of view of rails but it plays fairly well with mongoid.
